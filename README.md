# Brave Search Startpage Image Service
Install by [viewing raw of 'startpageImagesBraveSearch.user.js'](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/BraveSearch-with-Startpage-Images/raw/main/startpageImagesBraveSearch.user.js) \
 Use images provided by StartPage in Brave Search \
 Better than using Bing or Google. \

I don't know why Brave didn't renew their contract or whatever they had with Microsoft before removing images from Brave Search... Maybe Microsoft didn't want to renew. \
But, this works for now.
